UC Berkeley DA Bootcamp Module 4 Challenge

Included in this project is code analyzing the data from several schools in a district, across several factors: budget, school type, student performance, size, and more.
I have drawn a couple conclusions from this data: 
1. While funding seems to support learning generally, it is not true that funding alone helps students achieve the best results.
   Schools with a budget of less than $585 per student did better, if not just as well, as schools that spent more on their students.
2. Likewise, the size of a school seems correlated with the success of students.
   Medium schools with between 1000 and 2000 students did the best in terms of student grades, with 90% passing overall.
